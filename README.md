# GooglyBooks
Google Books Search via React

In this app you can search for books by (author, title, etc) and the Google Books API app will return the results back to you. You will be able to also save the books, and pull up your saved books. Clicking the View button will show further details of a book in an external tab or window to the Google Books API website, with more information. You can also delete books that you have saved.
